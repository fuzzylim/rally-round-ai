## Authentication Middleware

The authentication middleware has been significantly improved to prevent 404 infinite redirect loops while maintaining secure route protection. The key improvements include:

1. **Robust Route Detection**
   - Middleware now properly detects known routes vs. unknown routes
   - Unknown routes bypass authentication checks to prevent infinite loops
   - System paths (static files, API routes) are properly excluded

2. **Server-Side 404 Handling**
   - Added a proper server-side 404 page component
   - Follows Next.js 15 best practices for error handling

3. **Client-Side Improvements**
   - AuthProvider now checks if a route is known before triggering refreshes
   - Prevents unnecessary client-side navigation on non-existent routes

## Test Status

The middleware has been manually tested and confirmed working for:
- Public routes (`/`, `/login`, `/competitions`)
- Protected routes (`/dashboard`, `/teams`, `/fundraisers/create`)
- Non-existent routes (properly showing 404 page without redirect loops)

### Automated Tests

Automated tests are currently a work in progress due to ESM compatibility issues with Jest and certain dependencies (`strip-ansi`, `string-width`). The following approaches have been attempted:

1. **Mock Dependencies**
   - Created mocks for problematic dependencies
   - Updated Jest configuration to use these mocks

2. **Simplified Test Configuration**
   - Created a simplified Jest configuration (`jest.simple.js`)
   - Modified test scripts to use this configuration

3. **Simplified Test Approach**
   - Rewrote tests to focus on core functionality
   - Reduced dependency on problematic modules

### Next Steps for Testing

To complete the automated testing:

1. Consider using a different test runner that better supports ESM
2. Upgrade dependencies to versions with better ESM compatibility
3. Implement more granular mocking of problematic dependencies

## Security Considerations

The authentication system continues to follow best practices:
- Uses HttpOnly cookies instead of localStorage
- Implements PKCE flow for authentication
- Properly handles session exchange in auth callbacks
- Securely manages token refreshing

## Manual Testing Checklist

- [x] Public routes accessible without login
- [x] Protected routes redirect to login when not authenticated
- [x] Login redirects to dashboard when already authenticated
- [x] 404 pages render correctly without infinite loops
- [x] Static resources load properly
- [x] Auth callback processes correctly
