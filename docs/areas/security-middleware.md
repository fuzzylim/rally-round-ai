# üîí Middleware Security

> This document outlines security considerations and implementations for RallyRound's authentication middleware.

## Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

### üõ°Ô∏è Middleware Auth Middleware Vulnerability (April 2025)

**Issue**: The authentication middleware was using the deprecated `createMiddlewareClient` and `createRouteHandlerClient` methods from `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` which have potential security vulnerabilities in how they handle session cookies and tokens.

**CVE Reference**: N/A (Internal finding #4)

**Fix Implementation**:
- Replaced deprecated `createMiddlewareClient` and `createRouteHandlerClient` with direct `createClient` from `@supabase/supabase-js`
- Implemented secure token extraction from cookies
- Added proper authentication headers
- Disabled auto-refresh and auto-detection features that could lead to security issues
- Added error handling for missing configuration

**Code Locations**:
- `/apps/public-frontend/middleware.ts`
- `/apps/admin-frontend/middleware.ts`

**Implementation Details**:
```typescript
// Secure implementation of Supabase client in middleware
const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey, {
  auth: {
    autoRefreshToken: false,
    persistSession: false,
    detectSessionInUrl: false
  },
  global: {
    headers: {
      Authorization: authCookie ? `Bearer ${authCookie}` : ''
    }
  }
});
```

## Cookie Security Best Practices

When working with authentication in middleware, follow these best practices:

1. **Direct Token Access**: Extract tokens directly from cookies instead of relying on helper libraries that might have vulnerabilities
2. **Explicit Headers**: Set Authorization headers explicitly rather than allowing libraries to extract and set them
3. **Disable Auto Features**: Turn off features like `autoRefreshToken` and `detectSessionInUrl` in middleware context
4. **Error Handling**: Always handle missing configuration gracefully
5. **Minimal Persistence**: Don't persist sessions in middleware

## Further Security Considerations

- Review cookie settings periodically to ensure they use `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and proper `SameSite` attributes
- Consider implementing additional CSRF protection for sensitive operations
- Log authentication attempts for security monitoring
