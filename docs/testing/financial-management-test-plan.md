# Financial Management Test Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Financial Management module of the RallyRound platform. It covers unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure the functionality works correctly and reliably.

## Test Environments

1. **Development Environment**
   - Local development setup with mock data
   - In-memory database for unit tests
   - Supabase local emulator for integration tests

2. **Staging Environment**
   - Deployed to Vercel preview environments
   - Connected to Supabase test project
   - Isolated from production data

3. **Production Environment**
   - Final verification in production environment
   - Limited to non-destructive tests
   - Monitoring for errors and performance issues

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests

Unit tests will focus on testing individual components and functions in isolation.

#### Database Schema (Drizzle ORM)

1. **Budget Schema Tests**
   - Verify schema validation rules
   - Test relationships between budgets and categories
   - Ensure proper type safety

2. **Expense Schema Tests**
   - Verify schema validation rules
   - Test relationships between expenses and budgets
   - Test relationships between expenses and teams/events

3. **Fundraising Schema Tests**
   - Verify schema validation rules
   - Test relationships between campaigns and donations
   - Test relationships between campaigns and teams/events

#### API Endpoint Tests

1. **Budget API Tests**
   - Test CRUD operations for budgets
   - Verify authorization rules
   - Test error handling

2. **Expense API Tests**
   - Test CRUD operations for expenses
   - Test file upload for receipts
   - Verify authorization rules
   - Test error handling

3. **Fundraising API Tests**
   - Test CRUD operations for campaigns
   - Test donation processing
   - Verify authorization rules
   - Test error handling

#### UI Component Tests

1. **Budget Management Component Tests**
   - Test budget form validation
   - Test budget category management
   - Test budget vs. actual comparison chart

2. **Expense Tracking Component Tests**
   - Test expense form validation
   - Test receipt upload component
   - Test expense listing and filtering

3. **Fundraising Component Tests**
   - Test campaign form validation
   - Test donation form validation
   - Test progress tracking visualization

### Integration Tests

Integration tests will verify that different components work together correctly.

1. **Budget and Expense Integration**
   - Test creating expenses against budget categories
   - Verify budget totals update correctly
   - Test budget vs. actual calculations

2. **Team and Budget Integration**
   - Test team-specific budget creation
   - Verify team expense tracking
   - Test team budget reporting

3. **Event and Fundraising Integration**
   - Test event-specific fundraising campaigns
   - Verify event budget and expense tracking
   - Test event financial reporting

4. **Payment Processing Integration**
   - Test payment gateway integration
   - Verify donation processing
   - Test refund processing

### End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests will simulate real user scenarios to ensure the entire system works correctly.

1. **Event Budget Management Scenario**
   - Create a new event with budget
   - Add budget categories and allocations
   - Record expenses against budget
   - Generate budget vs. actual report

2. **Team Fundraising Scenario**
   - Create a team fundraising campaign
   - Process multiple donations
   - Track progress toward goal
   - Close campaign and generate report

3. **Financial Reporting Scenario**
   - Create multiple budgets and expenses
   - Record donations across campaigns
   - Generate comprehensive financial report
   - Export data in different formats

## Test Data

1. **Mock Data for Development**
   - Predefined budgets, expenses, and campaigns
   - Sample receipts and documents
   - Mock payment transactions

2. **Test Fixtures**
   - Reusable test data for consistent testing
   - Reset database between test runs
   - Seed data for specific test scenarios

## Testing Tools

1. **Unit and Integration Testing**
   - Vitest for unit and integration tests
   - React Testing Library for component tests
   - MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking

2. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Playwright for browser automation
   - Custom test helpers for authentication
   - Visual regression testing

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Lighthouse for performance metrics
   - Custom load testing scripts
   - Vercel Analytics for real-world performance data

## Test Automation

1. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Run tests on every pull request
   - Block merges if tests fail
   - Generate test coverage reports

2. **Test Reporting**
   - Detailed test results in CI/CD pipeline
   - Visual test reports for UI components
   - Performance trend analysis

## Test Schedule

1. **Development Phase**
   - Write unit tests alongside code development
   - Run integration tests daily
   - Manual testing of new features

2. **Pre-Release Phase**
   - Complete end-to-end test suite
   - Performance testing and optimization
   - Security testing

3. **Post-Release Phase**
   - Ongoing monitoring and regression testing
   - User feedback collection and analysis
   - Continuous improvement of test coverage

## Acceptance Criteria

For a feature to be considered ready for release, it must:

1. Have at least 80% unit test coverage
2. Pass all integration tests
3. Pass all end-to-end tests
4. Meet performance benchmarks
5. Be reviewed and approved by at least one other developer
6. Be tested manually by a QA resource or product owner
